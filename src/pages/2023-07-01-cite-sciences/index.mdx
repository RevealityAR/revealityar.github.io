The mobile application _Revy_ is being used by [Natacha Paquignon](https://www.natachapaquignon.com/) and our team to introduce people to Augmented Reality as part of the Carrefour Numérique activities at the Cité des Sciences (2023 and 2024).

## Continuous flow workshops

We designed a flexible workshop format adapted to the venue's family audience: from 5 to 25 minutes per participant, 
depending on their available time. We have adapted the *Revy* application to allow this flexibility.

## From initiation to creation

- __Activity 1__ : Discover Augmented Reality content, understand and grasp this technology.
- __Activity 2__ : Film yourself and create your own virtual double with the *Revy* application
- __Activity 3__ : become part of Augmented Reality in space: in miniature, flying, climbing walls, etc.

## The result : an exhibition

Search and film the images hidden around the site to reveal the participants' creations. Between 2023 and 2024, the exhibition route evolved according to the workshops and the changing spaces of the venue.
 For example: participants were able to integrate themselves into an ephemeral papier-mâché work, exhibited in March 2024.

## Master the tools

* Participants leave with the free _Revy_ mobile application and can continue to create independently at home.
* We have trained the Carrefour Numérique mediation teams so that they can continue to run workshops independently.
