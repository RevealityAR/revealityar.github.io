# The project in a nutshell

A urban walk in Augmented Reality in a large cultural complex, created with local residents through dance, writing, visual and sound creation workshops.

- A participatory creative process involving local cultural institutions and residents
- The public can trigger a variety of content with the _Revy app: sound, video, 3D and access to explanatory screens
- The tour can be accessed on the site's equipment, but also on the public's smartphones, with the _Revy_ application
