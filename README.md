# My Gatsby Template

## How to install

`npm i --legacy-peer-deps`

Legacy peer deps required at this point for some legacy gatsby dependencies.

* Make sure to also fetch the git submodule "bits"

## Features

- MDX
- Custom commponents for MDX
- SEO
- i18n for markdown and tsx pages

# Rules to create new pages

## Markdown Blog Post

- Make sure to include the date in folder name. It's used for a workaround for i18n. The workaround works until 2030

## Markdown pages

- Make sure to name your folder with the prefix "page". Still a workaround for i18n
